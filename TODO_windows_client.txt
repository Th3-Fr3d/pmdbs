WINDOWS CLIENT TODO:

    - DESIGN / CREATE UI
        - create Data screen
            - create NoSelection panel
        - create Welcome screen
            - some sort of dashboard
        - create Login screen
            - TRANSPARENCY ISSUE APPROACH:
                - exchange semi-transparent panel with picture box
                - use gray bitmap image for picturebox with A of 150 or so (hopefully resulting in a semi transparent panel)
                - use BackColor = Color.Transparent for all Child Coltrols and set Parent to picture box
        - create Settings screen
        - create Add screen/panel
            - use scrollview (flowlayoutpanel)
                - custom scrollbars
            - too much free space when maximized --> fill empty space
            - create better icons for AdvancedNumericUpDown
        - create Loading screen
        - create Credits screen (used way too much licensed crap)
        - create Account screen
        - create Account_edit screen
    
    - TWEAKS / FIXES
        - allow EditFields to have default text prompt
            - deletes on focus
            - appears if AdvancedTextBox is empty
        - menu bar
            - slightly decrease size of icons
        - AddPanel
            - add descriptions
            - custom scrollbars
        - EditPanel
            - add password generator (copypasta)
        
    - CODE OPTIMIZATION:
        - never heard of it --> total mess
        - performance optimization
            - suspend layout for hidden panels
            - disable hidden controls
            
    - CREATE CORE:
        - In Settings: set sorting algorithm for ListEntrys
        - Rename all variables to something meaningful
        - create method to get Icons from websites (urls) to show in ListEntry
            - use http://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip2/www.github.com.ico to get icons
            - https://i.olsh.me/ MAY BE BETTER
        - allow switching between menu points
        - allow using local certificate to validate server --> settings
        
        
    - CREATE DATABASE ACCESS METHODS
