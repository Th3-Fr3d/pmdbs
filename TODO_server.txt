- PasswordManager v2
	SERVER TODO:
		- TESTING:
			Nothing :)
			
		- OPTIMIZATION:
			Nothing :)
			
		- HIGH PRIORITY:
			- Standardize return values sent to client
			- Check client's version during handshake
			- Fix password leak ("password update check") --> try signing in instead
			- Create Online CredentialCheck() - Method --> Only return Bool to client
				- can be used in case of password change without compromizing security
				
		- MEDIUM PRIORITY:
			Nothing :)
			
		- LOW PRIORITY (FINISH CLIENTS FIRST):
			- Admin features:
				- delete accounts
				
		- CANCELLED:
			- Change admin setup:
				- one "__ROOT__" user ("master admin")
				- __ROOT__ can promote users to become admin 
				--> better maintenance for an admin team
