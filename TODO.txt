- PasswordManager v2
	SERVER TODO:
		- HIGH PRIORITY:
			- garbage collection on boot --> clean up database
			- update logging
			- bug fixing
				- shutdown sometimes not working correctly
			- Admin features:
				- list all accounts (including offline)
		- LOW PRIORITY (FINISH CLIENTS FIRST):
			- Change admin setup:
				- one "__ROOT__" user ("master admin")
				- __ROOT__ can promote users to become admin 
				--> better maintenance for an admin team
			- Admin features:
				- delete accounts
	DEBUG / ADMIN CLIENT TODO:
		- continue dynamic query creation (no more hard coding)
		- request cookie
